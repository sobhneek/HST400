## A Description of HST400
The [Health Studies Program](https://www.uc.utoronto.ca/health-studies) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) offers students an opportunity to complete a year long practicum placement for a course credit. The practicum placement allows students to supplement our academic understanding of health conditions, behaviours, care systems, and policy issues with practical application of that knowledge in a workplace environment that is relevant to the health(care) area in which we want to develop our future career.
