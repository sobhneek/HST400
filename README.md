# A Description of HST400
This repository will house various aspects to my HST400 Practicum Project 

The Health Studies Program offers students an opportunity to do a practicum placement for course credit in order to supplement our academic understanding of health conditions, behaviours, care systems, and policy issues with practical application of that knowledge in a workplace environment that is relevant to the health(care) area in which we want to develop our future career.
