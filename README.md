## What Is [HST400](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/hst400y1)?
The [Health Studies Program](https://www.uc.utoronto.ca/health-studies) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) offers students an opportunity to complete a year long practicum placement for a course credit. The practicum placement allows Health Studies students to supplement our academic understanding of health conditions, behaviours, care systems, and policy issues with practical application of that knowledge in a workplace environment that is relevant to the area in which we want to develop our future career. 


## Placement

My practicum placement will be at [KITE](https://kite-uhn.com); specifically, I will work under the supervision of [Dr. Bethell](https://kite-uhn.com/scientist/jennifer-bethell) in [EnCOAR](https://www.encoarteam.com). At [KITE](https://kite-uhn.com) and [EnCOAR](https://www.encoarteam.com), I will assist [Dr. Bethell](https://kite-uhn.com/scientist/jennifer-bethell) and others in their ongoing projects. My scope of work would include creating grant applications, evaluation reports, conducting data analysis and scoping reviews. On top of completing ongoing tasks with EnCOAR, I will be starting my own research project under the guidance of [Dr. Bethell](https://kite-uhn.com/scientist/jennifer-bethell). This repository will house my progress and polished work for the project.
